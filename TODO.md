## 🚀 Next Phase: Enhancement & Scale

### v1.0.0 - Production Release

### UX Improvements ✅
- [x] **Context file support** - `.tfgrid-compose.yaml` in project root
  - Auto-detect app from context file
  - Eliminate need to specify app path every time
  - Example: `tfgrid-compose agent list` (no app path needed)
- [x] **Built-in `agent` subcommand** - Shorthand for AI agent operations
  - `tfgrid-compose agent list`
  - `tfgrid-compose agent run <project>`
  - `tfgrid-compose agent create`
  - `tfgrid-compose agent stop <project>`
  - `tfgrid-compose agent monitor <project>`
  - `tfgrid-compose agent remove <project>`
- [ ] Shell completion (bash/zsh/fish) - Future enhancement

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] Automated integration tests
- [ ] Unit tests for core functions
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] End-to-end deployment tests
- [ ] Error scenario testing

**Reliability Improvements**
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient failures (apt locks, network timeouts)
- [ ] State recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Rollback capability

**Testing Plan:**
```bash
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── test-state-management.sh
│   └── test-yaml-parser.sh
├── integration/
│   ├── test-single-vm-pattern.sh
│   └── test-deployment-flow.sh
└── e2e/
    └── test-full-lifecycle.sh
  fi
  if [ $attempt -lt $MAX_RETRIES ]; then
    log_warning "Ansible failed (attempt $attempt/$MAX_RETRIES), retrying in ${RETRY_DELAY}s..."
    sleep $RETRY_DELAY
  fi
done
```

### 3. Complete Pattern Generalization
**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** 🔄 Partial

**Remaining Tasks:**
- [x] Rename `ai_agent_common` → `common`

- [ ] Make Ansible roles generic per pattern
- [ ] Test with a second app to verify reusability

**Files:**
- `patterns/single-vm/platform/roles/*`
- `patterns/single-vm/platform/site.yml`

## 📞 Questions to Resolve

1. **App Structure:** Should we standardize on a required structure or make it flexible?
2. **Patterns:** Should Ansible roles be pattern-specific or app-specific?
3. **State:** Should we use SQLite for state instead of YAML?
4. **Rollback:** Critical feature or nice-to-have?
5. **Testing:** Manual testing or CI/CD automated?
