## Overview

TFGrid Deployer is a production-ready deployment platform that makes deploying applications on ThreeFold Grid as simple as `tfgrid-compose up`.

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **One-command deployment** - From zero to running app in 2-3 minutes
- ‚úÖ **Multiple patterns** - single-vm, gateway, k3s (coming soon)
- ‚úÖ **Smart validation** - Checks prerequisites and prevents errors
- ‚úÖ **Remote execution** - Run commands on deployed VMs from your local machine
- ‚úÖ **State management** - Tracks all deployments automatically
- ‚úÖ **Idempotency** - Safe to retry, prevents duplicate deployments

## Current Status

**üéâ PRODUCTION READY - v0.1.0-mvp**

### Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] Full deployment orchestration (Terraform + WireGuard + Ansible)
- [x] Input validation and error handling
- [x] Idempotency protection
- [x] Remote command execution (`exec`)
- [x] Quick start documentation
- [x] Installation script
- [x] Help system with examples
- [x] Single-VM pattern (fully tested)

### In Development üöß
- [ ] Gateway pattern (scaffolded)
- [ ] K3s pattern (scaffolded)
- [ ] Automated test suite
- [ ] Video tutorials

## Patterns

### single-vm 

Single VM deployment with Wireguard and Mycelium networking.

**Use cases:**
- Development environments
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- Internal services
- AI agents
- Background workers

---

### gateway 

Gateway VM with public IPv4 + backend VMs with private networking.

**Use cases:**
- Production web applications
- E-commerce sites
- Multi-tier applications
- Traditional hosting with public access

**Features:**
- Public IPv4 on gateway
- Nginx reverse proxy
- SSL/TLS termination
- Load balancing
- Private backend network

---

### k3s 

Kubernetes cluster (K3s) with master and worker nodes.

**Use cases:**
- Cloud-native applications
- Microservices architectures
- Production SaaS platforms
- High availability requirements

**Features:**
- Lightweight Kubernetes (K3s)
- Traefik ingress controller
- Local-path storage provisioner
- kubectl access
- Auto-scaling workers

**Commands supported:**
- `logs` - Show application logs
- `status` - Check application status
- `address` - Show IP addresses

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tfgrid-compose/tfgrid-deployer
cd tfgrid-deployer

# Run installer (adds to PATH)
./install.sh
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Terraform or OpenTofu
- Ansible
- WireGuard (for private networking)
- ThreeFold Grid account with mnemonic

See [Quick Start Guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup.

### 2. Configure

```bash
# Store your mnemonic
mkdir -p ~/.config/threefold
echo "your twelve word mnemonic" > ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic
chmod 600 ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic
```

### 3. Deploy

```bash
# Deploy an application
tfgrid-compose up ../tfgrid-ai-agent
```

That's it! Your app is deployed and running. üéâ

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Deploy an application
tfgrid-compose up <app-path>

# Execute commands on deployed VM
tfgrid-compose exec <app-path> <command>

# Check deployment status
tfgrid-compose status <app-path>

# SSH into VM
tfgrid-compose ssh <app-path>

# View logs
tfgrid-compose logs <app-path>

# Destroy deployment
tfgrid-compose down <app-path>
```

### Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Deploy the AI agent
tfgrid-compose up ../tfgrid-ai-agent

# 2. Use it (from your local machine!)
tfgrid-compose exec ../tfgrid-ai-agent login
tfgrid-compose exec ../tfgrid-ai-agent create my-webapp
tfgrid-compose exec ../tfgrid-ai-agent run my-webapp

# 3. Check what's happening
tfgrid-compose status ../tfgrid-ai-agent
tfgrid-compose exec ../tfgrid-ai-agent logs my-webapp

# 4. SSH if needed
tfgrid-compose ssh ../tfgrid-ai-agent

# 5. Destroy when done
tfgrid-compose down ../tfgrid-ai-agent
```

### Using Make (Convenience)

```bash
# Set app once
export APP=../tfgrid-ai-agent

# Then use short commands
make up
make status
make ssh
make down
```

### What Happens During Deployment

1. ‚úÖ **Validates** prerequisites (Terraform, Ansible, mnemonic)
2. ‚úÖ **Checks** app manifest and structure
3. ‚úÖ **Prevents** duplicate deployments
4. ‚úÖ **Creates** VM infrastructure (Terraform)
5. ‚úÖ **Configures** WireGuard networking
6. ‚úÖ **Waits** for SSH readiness
7. ‚úÖ **Configures** platform (Ansible - 15+ tasks)
8. ‚úÖ **Deploys** application source code
9. ‚úÖ **Runs** deployment hooks (setup ‚Üí configure ‚Üí healthcheck)
10. ‚úÖ **Verifies** deployment success
11. ‚úÖ **Saves** state for management

**Total time:** 2-3 minutes ‚ö°

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Validation tests

make status APP=../tfgrid-ai-agent
make down APP=../tfgrid-ai-agent
```

### Contributing

Contributions welcome! See [Contributing Guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Troubleshooting

See [Quick Start Guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md#troubleshooting) for common issues.

**Quick fixes:**
- Missing prerequisites: `tfgrid-compose up` will tell you what's missing
- Existing deployment: `make down APP=<app>` then redeploy
- State corruption: `make clean` (‚ö†Ô∏è removes state)
