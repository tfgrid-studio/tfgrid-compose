## Overview

TFGrid Compose is a production-ready deployment platform that makes deploying applications on ThreeFold Grid as simple as `tfgrid-compose up`.

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **One-command deployment** - From zero to running app in 2-3 minutes
- ‚úÖ **Context file support** - Set app once, use short commands everywhere
- ‚úÖ **Agent subcommand** - Simple AI agent management (`tfgrid-compose agent list`)
- ‚úÖ **Auto-install** - Automatically sets up PATH in your shell
- ‚úÖ **Multiple patterns** - single-vm, gateway, k3s (coming soon)
- ‚úÖ **Smart validation** - Checks prerequisites and prevents errors
- ‚úÖ **Remote execution** - Run commands on deployed VMs from your local machine
- ‚úÖ **State management** - Tracks all deployments automatically
- ‚úÖ **Idempotency** - Safe to retry, prevents duplicate deployments

## Current Status

**üéâ COMPLETE FIRST LAYER - v2.0.0**

All 3 core deployment patterns are production-ready!

### v1.0 Features ‚úÖ
- [x] Full deployment orchestration (Terraform + WireGuard + Ansible)
- [x] Context file support (`.tfgrid-compose.yaml`)
- [x] Agent subcommand for AI agent management
- [x] Automatic PATH setup during installation
- [x] Input validation and error handling
- [x] Idempotency protection
- [x] Remote command execution (`exec`)
- [x] Comprehensive documentation
- [x] Auto-install with `make install`
- [x] Single-VM pattern (fully tested)

### All 3 Core Patterns Complete! ‚úÖ
- [x] **Single-VM pattern** - Development, databases, AI agents
- [x] **Gateway pattern** - Production web apps with public IPv4, SSL, load balancing
- [x] **K3s pattern** - Kubernetes clusters for cloud-native apps

### Coming Soon üöß
- [ ] Automated test suite
- [ ] Shell completion (bash/zsh/fish)
- [ ] Video tutorials
- [ ] Web dashboard

## Patterns

### single-vm ‚úÖ **Production Ready**

Single VM deployment with Wireguard and Mycelium networking.

**Use cases:**
- Development environments
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- Internal services
- AI agents
- Background workers

**Documentation:** [patterns/single-vm/](patterns/single-vm/)

---

### gateway ‚úÖ **Production Ready**

Gateway VM with public IPv4 + backend VMs with private networking.

**Use cases:**
- Production web applications
- E-commerce sites
- Multi-tier applications
- Public-facing services

**Features:**
- Public IPv4 on gateway
- Nginx/HAProxy reverse proxy
- Free SSL/TLS (Let's Encrypt)
- Load balancing & health checks
- Private backend network
- Network redundancy (WireGuard + Mycelium)

**Documentation:** [patterns/gateway/README.md](patterns/gateway/README.md)

---

### k3s ‚úÖ **Production Ready**

Kubernetes cluster (K3s) with control plane, workers, and management node.

**Use cases:**
- Cloud-native applications
- Microservices architectures
- Production SaaS platforms
- High availability requirements

**Features:**
- Lightweight Kubernetes (K3s)
- MetalLB load balancer
- Nginx Ingress Controller
- Management node with kubectl, helm, k9s
- Local-path storage provisioner
- HA control plane support

**Documentation:** [patterns/k3s/README.md](patterns/k3s/README.md)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
# Setup standard workspace
mkdir -p ~/code/github.com/tfgrid-studio
cd ~/code/github.com/tfgrid-studio

# Clone repositories
git clone https://github.com/tfgrid-studio/tfgrid-compose
git clone https://github.com/tfgrid-studio/tfgrid-ai-agent

# Install (auto-configures PATH)
cd tfgrid-deployer
make install
```

This automatically adds `tfgrid-compose` to your PATH!

**Note:** We use `~/code/github.com/{org}/{repo}` as the standard workspace structure. See [WORKSPACE_STANDARD.md](../WORKSPACE_STANDARD.md) for details.

**Prerequisites:**
- Terraform or OpenTofu
- Ansible
- WireGuard (for private networking)
- ThreeFold Grid account with mnemonic

See [Quick Start Guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup.

### 2. Configure

```bash
# Store your mnemonic
mkdir -p ~/.config/threefold
echo "your twelve word mnemonic" > ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic
chmod 600 ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic

# Create context file (optional but recommended)
echo "app: ../tfgrid-ai-agent" > .tfgrid-compose.yaml
```

### 3. Deploy & Use

```bash
# Deploy application (uses context)
tfgrid-compose up

# Use AI agent with simple commands
tfgrid-compose agent list
tfgrid-compose agent create
tfgrid-compose agent run my-project

# Specify app path every time
tfgrid-compose up ../tfgrid-ai-agent
tfgrid-compose status ../tfgrid-ai-agent
tfgrid-compose ssh ../tfgrid-ai-agent
tfgrid-compose down ../tfgrid-ai-agent
```

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Deploy
tfgrid-compose up [app-path]

# Execute commands on VM
tfgrid-compose exec [app-path] <command>

# AI Agent management (requires context)
tfgrid-compose agent list
tfgrid-compose agent create
tfgrid-compose agent run <project>
tfgrid-compose agent monitor <project>
tfgrid-compose agent stop <project>

# Status & logs
tfgrid-compose status [app-path]
tfgrid-compose ssh [app-path]
tfgrid-compose logs [app-path]

# Destroy
tfgrid-compose down [app-path]
```

### Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Setup context
echo "app: ../tfgrid-ai-agent" > .tfgrid-compose.yaml

# 2. Deploy
tfgrid-compose up

# 3. Use AI agent
tfgrid-compose agent create
# Follow prompts: name, duration, prompt

# 4. Monitor
tfgrid-compose agent list
tfgrid-compose agent monitor my-project

# 5. Cleanup
tfgrid-compose agent stop my-project
tfgrid-compose down
```

## How It Works

**Complete deployment flow:**
1. ‚úÖ **Validates** prerequisites and configuration
2. ‚úÖ **Plans** infrastructure with Terraform
3. ‚úÖ **Provisions** VM on ThreeFold Grid
4. ‚úÖ **Configures** WireGuard networking
5. ‚úÖ **Waits** for SSH to be ready
6. ‚úÖ **Runs** Ansible playbooks
7. ‚úÖ **Deploys** application source code
8. ‚úÖ **Runs** deployment hooks (setup ‚Üí configure ‚Üí healthcheck)
9. ‚úÖ **Verifies** deployment success
10. ‚úÖ **Saves** state for management

**Total time:** 2-3 minutes ‚ö°

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash

```

### Contributing

Contributions welcome! See [Contributing Guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Troubleshooting

See [Quick Start Guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md#troubleshooting) for common issues.

**Quick fixes:**
- Missing prerequisites: `tfgrid-compose up` will tell you what's missing
- Existing deployment: `make down APP=<app>` then redeploy
- State corruption: `make clean` (‚ö†Ô∏è removes state)
