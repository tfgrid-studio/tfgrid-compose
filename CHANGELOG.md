## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.12] - 2025-10-17

- **Centralized version management**: Version now stored in single `VERSION` file instead of hardcoded in multiple places

## [0.10.11] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- **Global STATE_DIR override**: Removed global `STATE_DIR=".tfgrid-compose"` from common.sh that was overriding dynamic state paths

## [0.10.10] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed

## [0.10.9] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- **STATE_BASE_DIR fallback**: Added fallback value for STATE_BASE_DIR in validation to ensure correct state path resolution

## [0.10.8] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- **State validation using wrong directory**: Fixed `validate_deployment_exists()` to properly construct state path from app name

## [0.10.7] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- **Registry apps not resolved in status/logs/ssh**: Commands now properly resolve registry app names to cached paths

## [0.10.6] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- **App source not copied to VM**: Now copies `src/` directory to VM for apps that need source files during setup

## [0.10.5] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- **Destroy prompting for input**: Added `-input=false` to destroy command to use existing state without prompts

## [0.10.4] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- **Destroy deployment bug**: Fixed duplicate log paths in destroy command

## [0.10.3] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- **Force flag in unhealthy state**: `--force` now properly triggers cleanup for unhealthy deployments

## [0.10.2] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed - Critical Production Bugs üêõ
- **Missing `primary_ip_type` extraction**: Now properly extracted from Terraform outputs to fix connectivity detection
- **Stale Terraform state handling**: Auto-detects and cleans corrupted state from deleted deployments
- **Error state cleanup**: Automatically cleans partial state on deployment failures (disable with `TFGRID_DEBUG=1`)
- **State detection bug**: Fixed `is_app_deployed()` to check `state.yaml` instead of non-existent `vm_ip` file
- **Health check improvement**: `is_deployment_healthy()` now validates Terraform state integrity
- **Log-based detection**: Validates against previous deployment errors in terraform logs

### Added - Deployment Resilience ‚ú®
- **`--force` flag**: Force redeploy with `tfgrid-compose up <app> --force`
- **State validation**: `validate_terraform_state()`, `clean_stale_state()`, `is_deployment_healthy()`
- **Auto-recovery**: Detects stale state and cleans automatically on next deployment
- **Error trap**: Prevents corrupt state files from failed deployments
- **Multi-layer detection**: Checks state.yaml, terraform state, and error logs for stale deployments

### Changed
- Version bumped to v0.10.2
- Improved deployment error messages with recovery suggestions
- Enhanced state detection to support both old and new formats

## [0.10.1] - 2025-10-16

### Added - UX Improvements üéØ
- **`login` command**: Interactive credential setup with validation
- **`logout` command**: Securely remove stored credentials
- **`config` command**: Manage configuration (list, get, set, delete)
- **`docs` command**: Open documentation in browser (auto-detects xdg-open/open)
- **Credentials file**: Secure storage at `~/.config/tfgrid-compose/credentials.yaml`

- **Error messages**: Enhanced error messages with helpful guidance and next steps
  - Login errors now show setup guide links
  - Config errors provide usage examples
  - Validation errors include installation instructions
  - All errors follow consistent format with clear solutions
- **CRITICAL: Makefile install bug**: Fixed wrapper script generation - the installed binary was only a shebang line and didn't execute the actual script, causing all commands to silently fail
- **Registry URL**: Fixed registry URL to point to correct repo (`app-registry` not `registry`)
- **Registry parser**: Updated YAML parser to handle nested `apps.official`/`apps.verified` format
- **`update` command**: Added missing `exit 0` to prevent script from continuing after update completes

## [0.10.0] - 2025-10-15

  - `search` command - Browse and search available apps
